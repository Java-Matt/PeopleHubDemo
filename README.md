PeopleHubDemo is a Java Spring Boot application designed to manage data for three distinct types of individuals: Students, Employees, and Pensioners. This project highlights my ability to build robust, scalable, and extensible software solutions, integrating key features such as data validation, file handling, and concurrency control.

The system is centered around an abstract Person class, which acts as the foundation for all person types, sharing common attributes like first name, last name, email, personalNumber, height, and weight. These attributes are uniformly managed across all person types, ensuring consistency and simplicity in the application's design. Each subclass extends the Person class to introduce type-specific details: students have university information and scholarships, employees track professional experiences, and pensioners include pension amounts and years of work history.

One of the standout features of the system is its flexible data input options. Users can add or update records manually through a secure interface, with role-based access control ensuring that only authorized individuals can perform these operations. Additionally, the application supports bulk data uploads via file import. This functionality includes real-time progress monitoring and detailed status tracking, offering users a seamless way to manage large datasets.

Data integrity is a core focus of the system. Rigorous validation ensures that all inputs, whether manual or file-based, adhere to strict business rules. Examples include enforcing unique personal numbers, validating the non-overlap of employee work experiences, and checking the completeness of mandatory fields. These validations are implemented dynamically, with custom annotations designed to support a growing number of person types.

The application's search functionality is powered by a dynamic specification builder, enabling users to query person records using flexible filters. Whether searching for shared attributes or type-specific details, the system adapts effortlessly, returning accurate results across all person types. This dynamic querying mechanism ensures scalability and ease of use, even as new person types are introduced.

Concurrency control is handled with optimistic locking, preventing simultaneous data modification conflicts. This approach ensures that updates are consistent and secure, even in a multi-user environment. By cloning entities before updates and handling conflicts gracefully, the system demonstrates a commitment to maintaining data accuracy.

The project is also designed with extensibility in mind. By leveraging the Strategy Pattern, the system allows new person types to be added without modifying existing code. This modular approach ensures that the application remains maintainable and future-proof, capable of adapting to evolving requirements. Single-table inheritance is used to store all person types in one database table, simplifying data management while maintaining high performance.

Testing plays a critical role in ensuring the system's reliability. The project includes a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests, covering core functionalities like CRUD operations, file uploads, validations, and concurrency handling. These tests are complemented by additional scenarios for edge cases, ensuring that the system behaves as expected under various conditions.

The Person Management System is a reflection of my expertise in building practical, user-focused applications. It integrates advanced concepts like dynamic querying, validation, and concurrency control into a cohesive, scalable solution. With its combination of technical robustness and user-centric design, the system is well-suited for a variety of real-world use cases, from managing academic records in educational institutions to tracking employee data in corporate environments and handling pension records in social security systems.

By developing this project, I have demonstrated my ability to design and implement complex software solutions, adhering to best practices in software engineering and ensuring scalability, maintainability, and reliability.
